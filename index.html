							Equinox features 2 player combat in a single space-installation environment. Players are able to move around freely in 3D space
							and collect upgrades found around the stage. Collecting these upgrades will upgrade one of three pieces of equipment, the player’s
							weapon, ship body, or engine. Each of these three pieces of equipment have two different upgrades that can be found. Players can
							also swap out any of these upgrades if they so desire by finding and collecting another upgrade. In addition to shooting whatever
							weapon the player currently has equipped, players will also be granted additional abilities from any body or engine upgrades they
							pick up. Beyond upgrading, players’ goals are to shoot down and defeat the other player, earning points to win the game.

							The initial guiding concept for Equinox was laser tag. This informed both the decision to work on a competitive shooter game as
							well as the visual direction of the game, contrastig lit areas and objects with darker scenery. To differentiate Equinox from the
							vanilla shooter formula and and add more to the gameplay sandbox, abilities were added. With the same goal of expanding the options
							available to players at any given time, it was decided to work with a sci-fi, space theme. This tied in nicely with our visual
							style established thus far, as well as opening an avenue with which players could move more freely; having players play as
							mechanical space-ship-like constructs.
							<br>
							<br>
							The game begins with players positioned on oposite sides of the arena. Players each tasked with shooting down the other a total of
							five times in order to win the game, before the other can do so. To help them along in this task, players can collect various
							upgrades that are scattered around the map. Each upgrade will improve one of three pieces of equipment on the player's ship:
							the ship’s weapon, the ship's body, or the ship's engine. For each of these three different pieces of equipment, two different
							upgrades are available, each with its own advantages or disadvantages. Players can also swap out equipment at any point by
							finding and collecting an alternate upgrade. The weapon, which fires 'standard' shots can be upgraded to a 'spray' variant that
							fires faster but less accurately, or a 'missile' variant which fires slower but does more damage. The body can be upgraded to
							have either a shield ability, which will grant a player temporary invincibility, or to have a regeneration ability, which will
							regenerate the player's health over time at the price of haver a lower maximum health. The engine can be upgraded to a 'bounce'
							variant which grants a burst of speed when bumping into an obstacle or a 'slide' variant that offers quicker directional
							rotation capabilities.
							<br>
							<br>
							In making a game that offered full 3D movement, it was important to ensure that players were able to maintain orientation and were
							able to successfully navigate the game. Keeping this in mind, an auto-orientation feature was added early on that would keep players
							oriented to the ground, helping to prevent them from getting spatially confused. After playtesting and feedback, other usability
							options were added, such as the ability to strafe and tweaks to the level to help maintain clear, distinctive boundaries.

							The play space for Equinox went through a fair number of iterations of the course of its development. The map began as a fully
							spherical environment, populated with various obstacles and terrain. However, it was quickly determined that a completely spherical
							play space felt both awkwardly populated and made it easy to become disorientated. After this revelation, it was decided to work
							with a hemisphere as a playspace, rather than an entire sphere. It was also decided to give the play space an arena sort of feel,
							with a clear top and bottom. The arena play space was also iterated on a number of times. Most significantly, the various
							protrusions around the level were moved around, changed to become more distinct and assist with navigation, and broken up into
							smaller pieces, to allow players to weave in and out of them. The central column went through a similar fragmentation, and was also
							made to rotate, creation more evasion opportunities. Additionally, a central area was added beneath the pillar, with four entrances
							on the sides and one on the top. A ring was also added around the edge of the arena, with parts of it covered to varying degrees,
							creating another path of movement through the play space.
							<br>
							<br>
							Found below are the initial and final implementations of the hemispherical arena. Each is shown in wireframe from top, bottom,
							profile, and finally with faces filled.

							Quartz is a 3D platforming game built in Unity. Quartz features a simple, yet attractive crystalline aesthetic, making use of
							bright and exciting colors to create vibrant and visually entertaining experience. The game has players take control of a small,
							crystalline ball capable of rolling around and jumping. Envisioned in the style of 3D collectathon platformers, players are
							tasked with navigating platforming challenges and avoiding various obstacles while collecting 200 gems as their ultimate goal to
							complete the level.

							With a time restriction of five weeks, Quartz was intended to be small in scope from the beginning, more of a proof of concept than
							a fully realized game. One initial idea that was quickly scrapped to help keep the project in scope was including different forms
							for the player character to shift between. These different forms would have taken on different geometric shapes and offered
							offered different advantages and disadvantages in terms of movement capabilities. Although this idea was not implemented into the
							game, some of these ideas lived on in various ways, such as the cubic and triangular enemies, as well as the icy terrain
							found in the blue area.
							<br>
							<br>
							In its current state, Quartz contains one level comprised of a central hub area and three surrounding areas, each themed differently
							and containing unique mechanics and challenges. Players must collect 200 gems placed throughout the hub area and surrounding areas.
							Doing so will cause a staircase to rise out of the central platform of the hub area, leading to the end of the level. The red area
							features rising lava and platforms that will rise along with it, as well as cannons that will shoot the player to various locations.
							The blue area features slippery platforms, platforms that crumble under the players weight and bumper-like enemies that bounce the
							player away when touched. The yellow area features enemies that will try to crush the player as well as moving and rotating
							platforms.
							<br>
							<br>
							In addition to keeping things simple, it was also decided early on that having well-designed controls was of key importance. This
							could be said to be a necessity for any platforming game, but particularly so when rolling a ball around. Working in a playspace
							comprised of floating platforms in open space, nothing would ruin the experience faster than accidentally rolling off the edge
							constantly. With this in mind, Quartz was designed to be played with a controller, rather than a keyboard.

							Quartz's playspace changed little from its initial iteration to its final implementation. The key idea of having a central hub
							surrounded by three unique areas was decided upon early in development, as part of an effort to keep the project simple and in scope.
							Changes from the initial design were mostly limited to adjusting the size and positioning of platforms in each of the areas, as well
							as fully committing to a hexagonal design for platforms. The placement of the collectable gems was also not determined until later
							iterations of the level.

							Scriptslayer is a 2D hybrid RPG, puzzle, and typing game built in HTML5 with the Phaser framework. Players wander a dungeon fighting
							off enemies and unlocking the ability to progress further after defeating a certain amount. The player's progress throughout the
							dungeon overworld is periodically interrupted by RPG-style random encounters with various monsters that the player must defeat to
							continue onwards. Combat takes the form of an interface in which the player must type verbs to battle the enemies they come across.
							Players can make stronger attacks by taking advantage of a variety of special weaknesses each enemy has, as well as typing faster
							and reusing words fewer times.

							A majority of Scriptslayer's gameplay takes place in the typing-combat sequences, with the overworld acting as more of a framework
							and incentive to play long enough to experience a variety of enemies. Players can complete the game after making it through three
							rooms, but may fight as many enemies as they wish or are able to before dying in order to achieve a higher high score.
							<br>
							<br>
							At the beginning of the game, players have a default attack of 100, with enemies each having 400 health. Players can receive
							multipliers to their damage output by meeting certain criteria each turn of combat. First an formost among these is by typing a
							verb that takes advantage of an enemy's weakness, which awards a 2x bonus to the players attack. Some examples of weaknesses found
							within the game are typing COOK or BUTTER against a lobster enemy, typing BURN or PRUNE against a plant enemy, or typing POKE or
							BLIND against an eyeball enemy. Enemies are designed to have a number of fairly obvious weaknesses that fall within the realm of
							general knowledge and common association. In addition to exploiting enemy weaknesses, players will earn a multiplayer based on the
							time bar that decays over the player's turn. Typing an attack quickly will raise the player's score, in varying amounts, while
							failing to type anything before time runs out will result in a loss of action for that turn and a retaliating attack by the enemy.
							Additionally, players will be penalized with a negative multiplier for typing the same verb in succession, encouraging quick
							thinking and variety amongst the players responses. Finally, in each battle, players will be presented with a condition dictating
							that they use a minimum number of letters when typing a verb, with lower numbers being more common.
							<br>
							<br>
							In addition to the player's health and score, other elements will persist between battles. The number of times a verb has been used
							is tracked between battles, although this is reset upon entering a new area. Additionally, the player's base attack and defense
							persist throughout battles, and have a chance of increasing after defeating an enemy.
							<br>
							<br>
							Because the programming and mechanical design of the game itself was of chief importance for this project, visual assets were
							borrowed and edited from existing sprites, rather than being created from scratch.

							An Abandoned Vessel is a 2D, top-down shooter built in Unity. In this game, the player character finds themselves stranded on a
							derelict space station, infested with decaying alien zombies and with very little power remaining. The player must shoot their way
							through the aliens, navigating through procedurally generated areas by way of teleporter. Additionally, light is scarce and players
							must make use of their gun and flares that can be found around the space station to increase their field of vision.

							When beginning An Abandoned Vessel, the player has the ability to move around and shoot in any direction with their mouse. Soon
							after, players will find health med-packs that can be used to restore health and flairs that can be placed on the ground to create
							additional light. Both of these resources are limited, but players will find more as they continue to play. To help familiarize
							players with these mechanics and others, players are guided through a few short tutorial areas that sequentially introduce them
							to movement, items, enemies, and hazards.
							<br>
							<br>
							After completing the tutorial areas, players enter into the main portion of the game where they must survive and shoot their way
							through hordes of enemies. Players will need to defeat all of the enemies within an area to activate a teleporter that will take
							them to the next area. In addition the enemies and hazards, such as slippery floors and spike traps found within each area, players
							will be able to find a few pickups to help replenish their supplies if they explore thoroughly.
							<br>
							<br>
							In addition to a the light produced by the player's suit and a few sparely placed ambient lights, the player must create their own
							light, either by shooting bullets from their gun, or by placing flares. Bullets can be fired relatively quickly, but only produce a
							small amount of light. This is moderately effective in lighting a small line directly in front of the player, but fails to light
							a wider area. To accomplish this, players will need to use a flare, which will light an area in a radius around it. With a limited
							amount of resources, players will need to be careful when navigating the station and manage their resources carefully.

							Remnants of Aylkor is a card battle game for two to four players that is played on a game board. Each player has a deck of 50 cards
							as well as an additional hero unit card. There is also a neutral event card deck comprised of 16 cards. Finally, dice are needed as
							well as a number of tokens to keep track of the game's two resources, Cogs and Brew, as well of the health of player's unit cards.
							Players wage war against each other on the hexagonal-tiled game board and must effectively manage their resources and unit and tech
							cards to overcome their enemies and keep their hero unit alive while defeating any other hero units.

							Players take turns making actions with and moving their cards about the board. On a player's turn a number of different actions are
							available to be taken, including playing, building and moving units, activating units' abilities or tech cards, harvesting
							resources, and attacking hostile units. Players also draw one new card from their deck each turn. Some available actions are
							limited to one per turn, while others are limited by the amount of resources the player has. Players can conduct battle between
							their units and enemy units. When a unit depletes an enemy unit's health, that unit is destroyed. Additionally, there are three
							types of units, Organic, Mechanical and Elemental, as well as a fourth neutral type which is populated by Hero Units. The three
							types of units fall into a rock, paper, scissors trinity. Organic units are effective against Mechanical units, Mechanical units
							are effective against Elemental units, and Elemental units are effective against Organic units.

						Project Overview
					</h5>
					<br>
					<h3>
						This project was an exercise in creating a 2D platformer level. I chose to use Project Spark for this project because it provided an
						avenue to easily put together a level with pre-made pieces. I chose to make my level somewhat in the style of a Metroidvania game,
						though as it is fairly small in scope, it is fairly straightforward and meant to be reminiscent of an area that would be found early in
						a game.
						<br>
						<br>
						The player character can run and jump by default, but like any Metroidvania game, players can bolster their arsenal of abilities by
						collecting upgrades found throughout the game. Almost immediately upon starting the level, players gain the ability to shoot fireballs,
						which act as their primary form of attack. Players can shoot either directly ahead, or diagonally up or down. Later on, players gain a
						dash ability, allowing them to achieve quick horizontal movement and navigate large gaps or hazards. Finally, players can gain a
						stronger dash that allows them to break through stone blocks and damage enemies with their dash.
						<br>
						<br>
						The player will encounter a few different types of enemies throughout the level. Found first and most commonly are goblin enemies.
						These act as the standard fodder of the game, and will attack the player with melee attacks. Encountered next are flying bird enemies,
						which will hover around the player once they enter their range and periodically peck at them. Found less commonly are larger goblin
						enemies, which will remain in place and hurl magic attacks at the player. Finally, once they reach the end of the level, players will
						have to defeat a large golem enemy, which will attack the player with multiple projectile attacks.
						<br>
						<br>
						As this level is somewhat of a microcosm of a Metroidvania level, I made sure to include essential elements to a successful
						Metroidvania experience. First, and arguably most importantly, I made sure that players are forced to learn each new upgrade they find
						to progress onwards in the game. After finding the fireball ability, players must use it to destroy boxes before progressing. The dash
						must be used to cross a gap, and the upgraded dash must be used to destroy a stone block. I also included reasons and paths for players
						to backtrack through the level and retread old ground with their upgraded arsenal, giving them a feeling of progression and power as
						well as making the game space feel more connected. This was a major contributing factor to the direction I went with my aesthetic; I
						felt that a honeycombed ruins setting would feel at home with a Metroidvania play style.

					<br>
					<h3>
						Halo is a series I have a lot of investment in and experience with and was a familiar space for me to work within. This multiplayer map
						was designed from the ground up, primarily intended for the Slayer and Team Slayer gametypes, with four to eight players in mind,
						although it could comfortably support other gamemodes and numbers of players.
						<br>
						<br>
						The inspiration for this level came primarily from more vertical maps, such as Halo 2's Midship or Halo 4's Adrift. Although Halo 4
						supports multiple Armor Abilities, offering a wider range of options to players, I chose to design this map for a more classic Halo
						gameplay experience, where the only Armor Ability offered to players is Sprint. Likewise, players are restricted in terms of weapons.
						Rather than being able to choose from load-outs, players start with an Assault Rifle and a Pistol, and have to find other weapons
						scattered around the map. Weapon balancing was an important factor to consider when designing the map. As a result, power weapons are
						located in central, neutral locations and are relatively few in number, where less devastating weapons are more abundant.
						<br>
						<br>
						Lines of sight and confrontational hotspots were of key importance to my design process. Most central areas are broken up to some
						degree, with obstacles intentionally placed to at least partially obscure lines of sight, with the exception of the open top area, which
						is intentionally dangerous to linger in. I also wanted to provide players with many different options to navigate around the level. In
						addition to cycling through the three different vertical tiers of the level, the middle and bottom level feature a number of tunnels
						that lead in and out of each other, as well as the central areas.

					<h3>
						In this project, I wanted to make a dungeon in the style of those found in Legend of Zelda games. I determined Minecraft to be a good
						tool that would allow me to create an approximation of a Zelda dungeon. Beyond what is available in the base game, I also found a
						useful mod called Zelda Sword Skills that added additional functionalities to Minecraft, based off of various aspects of the Zelda
						games. I also used a Zelda texture pack to help make the dungeon look more akin to that of a Zelda game.
						<br>
						<br>
						Because this dungeon is built in Minecraft the game plays like Minecraft, but I made as many alterations as possible to make the game
						feel as close to a Zelda game as it could. I equipped the player with a sword and shield, the basic staples of a Zelda game. Progressing
						through the dungeon, players will eventually get a bow and arrows which can be used to shoot enemies and switches, a hookshot to latch
						onto faraway markers, food items to heal with, and keys to open locked doors. In typical Zelda fashion, players will receive these items
						from chests. Enemies that the player encounters will also appear familiar to Zelda fans. The Zelda Sword Skills mod has re-skinned
						Minecraft enemies such as Skeletons, Bats, and Slimes into enemies from the Zelda series such as Stalfos, Keese and Chu-Chu's.
						<br>
						<br>
						Another important aspect of Zelda games that I included into my Minecraft adaptation was the puzzles littered throughout dungeons.
						Puzzles in my dungeon include defeating the enemies in a room, finding and hitting switches, logic puzzles, and making use of special
						items such as the bow and arrows and the hookshot. Finally, after making their way through the dungeon, players are treated to a boss
						battle, against witches re-skinned as Koume and Kotake from the Zelda games. With the help of the Zelda Sword Skills mod, I was able to
						create a unique dungeon that successfully incorporates many elements of the Zelda games into a Minecraft setting.

						Project Overview
					</h5>
					<br>
					<h3>
						This project was an exercise in creating a realistic Mario level in the Mario Maker engine, with a partner. One of the popular trends
						in Mario Maker seems to be creating levels that are almost unbearably hard, which is something we wanted to avoid with this level.
						However, we still wanted to create a certain degree of challenge in our level, something that might feel at home in a secret world at
						the end of a Mario game, which is to say moderately difficult, but not frustratingly so. Although the aesthetic palettes of Mario
						Maker have little impact outside of offering a few different items, we decided to work in the Super Mario World palette, which was a
						favorite to both of us.
						<br>
						<br>
						Keeping in line with our thought of making what would be an end-game level, and for the sake of variety, we wanted to include a number
						of different elements within the level. We split our level into a number of different sections. The first section is intended as a warm
						up, and features straightforward encounters with enemies and fire bars to dodge. The next section kicks things up a notch, with an ice
						platform and more dangerous enemy encounters. Following this is our first section themed around an item, a helmet power-up unique to
						Mario Maker. This section relies on the use of the helmet to block the projectile hammer attacks of Hammer Bros above the player.
						After successfully navigating this section, the player is rewarded with a checkpoint, after which another item-based section takes place.
						The player must use the Super Feather to reach a high platform and then make use of its stalling capabilities to descend slowly through
						a number of spikes. The next section features Yoshi and has the player dodging more enemies and obstacles. After this, the player uses
						a Koopa Clown car the avoid enemies in the penultimate section. Finally, the player is treated to a relatively easy cooldown section
						right before the final goal.
						<br>
						<br>
						We found that the variety in our level did keep things fresh as we hoped, but after playtesting, we found that there were a number of
						areas that needed from balancing and refinement. In a number of sections, some enemies were adjusted or removed, to make things a bit
						easier in areas we were noticing large numbers of deaths. Additionally, some sections were adjusted more heavily. The initial section
						was given a second path, that is easier to navigate, but doesn't offer a power-up reward. The Yoshi section was also reworked with an
						alternate path, the features vine climbing and dodging instead. Finally, the Koopa Clown Car section was largely reworked to flow
						better.

						A layout for the initial iteration of the level can be seen below.

					<h3>
						In this project, I created a model of a small dragon, and fully rigged and animated it. Having previously worked on a human model
						and various other objects and props, I wanted to work on a creature of some sort. I decided on a dragon because I think they are
						visually interesting and have additional extremities in the form of wings and a tail. The character I envisioned and decided to work
						was a slightly anthropomorphized and its body reflects that; its forearms are more human-like and its backs legs are more hinged like
						various other animals. With a cartoonish look in mind a created a child-like small dragon. Reflective of these choices are its large
						head, small wings, and long tail that it would grow into. After finishing the model itself, I created a skeleton to support rigging,
						including the main limbs, head, tail, wings and ears. Finally, I created a series of three animations for the character. Idle, walk,
						and run cycles, although the walk and run cycles are really more flying cycles.

						My goal for this project was to model and texture a video game prop. I decided upon Majora's Mask, from the Zelda series game of the
						same name. Being relatively simple in shape, but visually intriguing and eye-catching it seemed like great choice. After modelling
						the shape of the mask, staying true to the source material, and setting up its UVs, I moved on to texturing the mask. Once again, I
						stayed close to the source material by utilizing the same colors as the original mask, with a few changes around the eyes to create
						a slightly different effect to my taste. At this point, I decided to deviate and add my own take on the mask by making ir look more
						realistic. This was primarily achieved by adding a grainy wooden texture to the mask, as well as a metallic rim to back of the mask.
						Finally, I baked an ambient occlusion map to make the highlights and shadows of the mask appear more realistic.

						This project was done to create a low-poly prop for a scene similar in theme to the recurring Death Mountain area from the legend of
						Zelda series. Commonly found around within the Zelda series are explosive plants called bomb flowers. I created my own interpretation
						of this Zelda staple by combining elements from bomb flowers from different Zelda games. I took the general shape of the bomb-like fruit
						from Skyward Sword's interpretation of the bomb flower; featuring a fuse-like protrusion atop the plant as well as an open, peeling top.
						The coloration was primarily inspired by the vibrant bomb flower plant from the Wind Waker, as was the leafy bottom of the plant. After
						modelling and coloring the bomb flower, I gave it a more realistic look by applying various textures to the different parts of the plant.
						I used an apple skin texture on the blue skin of the plant, a bumpy pumpkin-like texture on the exposed brown part of the fruit and a
						leafy texture on the leaves of the plants.

					<h3>
						This project was done in the style of some of
						<a href="http://marinkoillustration.com" target="_blank">Marinko Milosevski's</a> video game posters, which I find very appealing. This
						style uses a sort of minimalism, with only one or two prominent colors and some major object or symbol from the series creating a large
						positive-negative space split. One series that was not represented among Milosevski's posters and was on my mind at the inception of
						this project was the Pikmin series. I thought that the silhouettes of plants would be interesting to look at and that the Pikmin series'
						flower symbol would work well with this design style.
						<br>
						<br>
						Drawing from Milosevski's Ocarina of Time poster, I decided to use the Pikmin flower as a divide between positive and negative space,
						similarly adding a grassiness to the divide. Inside of the flower, I decided to set my scene as a recreation of Captain Olimar's
						crash landing upon the planet of PNF-404 at the beginning of the game. I thought that this would be a fitting moment to represent the
						game as a whole and would also strongly tie to the quote "I've crash landed on a strange planet...", a piece of Olimar's dialogue from
						the game.
						<br>
						<br>
						As I worked on designing the scene within the flower, I set Olimar's crashed ship in the background, with Olimar himself walking
						towards the foreground, where the silhouettes of Pikmin can be seen hiding among the grass. I found that this helped create a line
						of sight which drew the eyes from the top of the poster to the bottom, and alos provided enough spacing to make each silhouette
						separate and distinct.

						This goal of this project was to create a thought-provoking visual arrangement based on a certain word. I liked the idea of choosing
						a word that conveyed some degree of discomfort and craziness. Eventually I decided upon deranged as my word of choice and began
						building my piece from there. Working with a word that conveyed the idea of madness or insanity, I thought to design my piece such
						that it conveyed the feeling of an encroaching darkness that was invasive and eating away at or decaying sanity and composure.
						<br>
						<br>
						I chose a myriad of related or similar words and arranged them as thorny tendrils surrounding the space behind the centralized word
						deranged. I chose the font Osaka to use for the word deranged, as it appeared very ordered and neat. In stark contract, I used the font
						Goon Spectre for the thorned tendrils in the background, as they appeared messy and jagged. To add a little bit more variation
						and to help break up negative space, I used periods from the Goon Spectre font to add some particles to the scene, which I also thought
						created a feeling of crumbling and decay. Lastly, I decided to use a simple black and white color scheme to help highlight the
						contrasting themes and imagery within the image.

					<h3>
						This goal of this project was to create a faux movie poster. I zeroed in on an anime theme, and decided to make a character the main
						focus of the poster. The character I depicted on the poster has the ability to use fire magic, and so the theme of fire became an
						important visual element of the poster as a whole. Making the character appear somewhat serious, as though lost in thought about
						something important, I had him face off to the side of the poster. I also cloaked him in a fiery aura, with bits of actual flame
						igniting on and around him. I also gave his eyes a fiery glow and in conjunction with his fluttering mantle, added an indication of
						what might be a breeze, blowing the fiery aura behind him.
						<br>
						<br>
						Another element of major importance to the poster is the title of the movie, Ignition. In keeping with the fire theme, I made the title
						appear atop a background of scrap metal and the title itself appear to be made of a metal being heated up. Similar to the character,
						bits of flame and sparks are flying off of the title, though the title overall has a more ruddy color to it, in keeping with the metal.
						I chose the font Battlemage because I thought it looked appropriately like a magical script, befitting the character and the tying in
						nicely with the fiery theme.

						Project Overview

					<h3>
						This goal of this project was to create a faux album cover. I decided use a photo I took in Japan, of a series of stone lion heads,
						as a base. With this image, I wanted to create a balance between the text and the image itself, while at the same time blending them
						together. I decided to take a minimalist approach and make use of a gradient fill, which I find to to be very appealing visually.
						Infusing color with the original photo of a stone lion head on a wall, I arrived at the idea of graffiti as my imagery. Purple and
						orange are not colors I tend to often use in excess, but I thought that they popped nicely in this piece.
						<br>
						<br>
						Keeping with my minimalist approach I recreated the bricks behind the lion and applied a blob of graffiti paint on top of and at the
						bottom of the image, with the sitting comfortably in the middle. I added a number of paint dribbles coming down from the top of the
						image, which served a number of purposes. First, they added a sense of realism, as graffiti often runs to some degree. They also broke
						up the white space to either side of the lion and helped show the progression of the gradient. The messier paint splats below the lion
						also help to achieve this.
						<br>
						<br>
						The meaning of the phrase grasp the future is not something I decided upon with one set meaning. Rather, I intended it to be a
						generally positive message open to interpretation. I've found that in listening to Japanese music, there are many lyrics or phrases
						that share the same sort of openness and almost melodramatic symbolism that I was aiming for here. As my base photo originated from
						Japan, I thought it appropriately fitting that I attempt to capture the same feel as many of my favorite Japanese songs.
